# About-Me

# #_My name and more stuff about me_


My name is Esmhan Fadhel Awadh. My first name, Esmhan, was based off of an arab singer that my mother loved, my middle name, Fadhel, is the middle-name i inherited from my father. Its an Arab tradition for a child to take their fathers last names as a middle name. My full name runs on and on as i carry the names of my father, and my fathers father along with the ones before him. My last name, Awadh, translates to kindness compassion and generosity. With my name i carry the history of my parents and the men of my family before me, but i also carry the traits and characteristics my family has garnered for centuries.

## **My schools and childhood**

* PS 102.
    * i went here for elementary, just as all my siblings did when they immigrated. This school was what formed most of my childhood memories, but honestly a lot of the memories i have from elementary were getting the abundance of homework they assigned finished

* Mckinley
    * i went here for middle school, and met most of my current friends. Now that i look back on it, a lot of the teachers that i had here did a lot of things they couldve gotten reported for. Its disappointing to think that such a well known school among parents could get away with endangering and disrespecting its students.

* Telecommunications high school
    * i am going here for high school, and so far its a big improvement from the other schools ive gone to. It has a nice comfortable environment and the staff here is very compassionate
